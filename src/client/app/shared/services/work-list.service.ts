      content: `<p>Business problems today demand a new way to manage change effectively.
      Business processes need to be revised to innovate by managing change with fast growth</p>
      <p>Therefor it is important that a business is creative and adaptive to change so they
      represent the needs of the users. I created a model that helps companies with these necessary
      adjustments to become creative from the inside out.</p> <p>The model is built up in a few steps.
      The steps I created are a global approach. I established the steps during my graduation, after a
      long study in which I spoke to people working in the creative sector and people from the business
      industry to get a proper perception of the difference between both worlds and how they could
      learn from each other in there work processes.</p><p>For a company it would be use full to follow
      up all the steps in this process so it is possible to become creative from the inside out.
      To know more about the steps I invite you to swipe to the right..</p> <h3>Create to innovate</h3> <p>The first step to embed a creative 
      approach within a business is by recognising creativity in existing processes. How do teams work, what are there assets to the team and 
      how do they work together? A lot of people label themselves as ‘not creative’, this shows there is a misunderstanding about the definition 
      of creativity. This is a global explanation of what we will be starting out with. It is important that people can pinpoint their value and 
      how everybody can benefit from this to have the feeling they can rely on each other to ideate and create innovation.</p> 
      <h3>Creative process</h3><p>After having a clear understanding of what creativity is for the company and how this works in the existing 
      processes, we can start out with inserting a creative process. The creative process is based on processes used by designers for interesting 
      ideas that could lead to innovation. In this process we will help understand and find the users they serve.And how to adjust to their needs.</p>
      <h3>Big data analysis</h3><p>Nearly all of the data in the world nowadays did not exist two years ago. And if you look at the innovations that
       got grand the past years, that have taken an important role in the lives of western civilizations like Google, Wikipedia, Uber, Smartphones, 
       AirBnB are built on analytics and use Big Data! To find such an innovation, to change the world we live in, design thinking is one of the key 
       assets!</p> <p>So if you simplify this, to only analyze without combining it with design thinking will give you predictable outcomes. But Design 
       thinking without deep analysis leads to nothing. Leaders with the urge to grow will use both to find new interesting ways.</p>
       <p> One of these ways is to create more insight on the end-user. How are they using your product / service, when are they using it and why are they using it. This all is to be found on the web. But how can you find the right information that leads you to valuable insight? Big data in this way can help you increase the value of the product / service or even the experience of it.. </p>
       <p>To find a way managing Big Data is to know your users. Be empathetic that is why it is important for the IT department to see what 
       the true problem is they are coping with, to find the right data the IT department must collaborate in knowing there users. This is an 
       important part for a company to get a grip on their own existence.</p> <h3>Inhouse design schooling</h3> <p>To integrate design within 
       the core of the company there has to be a solid factor of creative thinking. The chance of not following up on learning new ways of 
       approaching old habits is big. To ensure creativity will be incorporated within the working processes of employees, this step will be 
       valuable for the route closer to a creative business.
      The previous steps showed the process of design thinkers. Employees generated insight on their own creativity, the value of creativity 
      within their own work processes, experienced the creativity and expertise of their co-workers, how they can cooperate to have a wider 
      perspective on how the ‘problem’ expresses itself. So the chance of bigger plans or innovations is possible.</p><p>The previous two steps, 
      “ Creative process” & “Big data design analysis” will be important to stay focused on. To integrate the creative mindset into the way the 
      participants work, will be repeated for as long as it takes to get them hands on within this mindset. Employees have to be more analytical 
      on their own process and know at what times working together will lead to a better outcome.</p>

      content: `<p>PoolPro is a game element that is used during football games in skyboxes and business lounges.
      In first place the game gives you the possibility to start a little competition between people in the lounge or skybox.</p>
      <p>To ensure that PoolPro covered the needs of the users and creates extra value to the surrounding we started a design
      research process and tested the needs of users with different methods. After this research we found there where some
      important needs in the skybox that weren’t yet covered. A skybox is indirectly a place where people network and look
      for potential business partners. In many skyboxes or lounges the people that attend to these events are not visible or easily to be found.</p>
      <p>PoolPro could easily help fill up these needs. PoolPro now helps with connecting people and makes it possible for businesses to place their
      information in the system to put them selves out there. Because of the fact some business lounges are to big for people to find each other
      connections are still not easy to make.  PoolPro helps cover this too, after finding some interesting connections you can send their
      information to your email, at the same time the connection will receive an email with your information too.</p><p>In this process I
      helped creating the extra value from PoolPro but also the whole graphic design of the product.</p>

      Astatine is one of the most rare metals on this earth and can only be found deep under the ground. The metal is highly radioactive.
      This underlines the idea of rareness. The only way someone can be part of Astatine is by having the right connections. A person can
      only get the app when a friend sends an invitations to them. Everybody that gets a invitation can invite two people to the party,
      but it'll have to be fast because the party can only hold 300 people in total. On the app you can see who is invited, what the
      location of the party is, this will be shown on the app 2 hours before the kick off, and what kind of Dj's there will be playing at Astatine.</p>
      <p>The logo I designed for the app is based on the electron shel of Astatine. By clicking on the dots in the app, it zooms in on information.</p>`
